      <li><strong> 965 AD </strong> Tofu is first mentioned in a document in China, the Ch'ing I Lu translated as Anecdotes, Simple and Exotic. The document implies that tofu was widely consumed in China in those days and that it was inexpensive food for the poor. </li>
    <li><strong> 1183 AD </strong> Tofu is first mentioned in the diary of a Shinto priest in Japan. The tofu was used as an offering at the shrine's altar. </li>
     <li><strong> 1183 AD </strong> Tofu is first mentioned in the diary of a Shinto priest in Japan. The tofu was used as an offering at the shrine's altar.</li>
      <li> <strong> 1603 </strong> The word "tofu" is first mentioned in a European-language document, the first dictionary of the Japanese language compiled by Christian Missionaries. Tofu is referred to as Cabe, Tôfu, or Taufu. </li>
      <li> <strong>1665 </strong> Tofu is discussed by a Westerner, Domingo Fernández de Navarrete, in his book A Collection of Voyages and Travels. Navarrete wrote: "Before I proceed to the next chapter, because I forgot it in the first book, I will here briefly mention the most usual, common and cheap sort of food all China abounds in, and which all men in that empire eat, from the emperor to the meanest Chinese, the emperor and great men as a dainty, the common sort as necessary sustenance. It is call'd teu fu, that is, paste of kidney-beans. I did not see how they made it. They draw the milk out of the kidney-beans, and turning it, make great cakes of it like cheeses, as big as a large sieve, and five or six fingers thick. All the mass is as white as the very snow, to look to nothing can be finer. It is eaten raw, but generally boil'd and dressed with herbs, fish, and other things. Alone it is insipid, but very good so dressed and excellent fry'd in butter. They have it also dry'd and smok'd, and mix'd with caraway-seeds, which is best of all. It is incredible what vast quantities of it are consum'd in China, and very hard to conceive there should be such abundance of kidney-beans. That Chinese who has teu fu, herbs and rice, needs no other sustenance to work; </li>
      <li> <strong>1700 </strong> James Flint respons to letter from Benjamin Franklin, asking about tofu. Flint writes a detailed description of how the "Chinese convert Callivances (soybeans) into Towfu." </li>
      <li> <strong> 1880 </strong>- Tofu is first made non-commercailly in Europe by Paillieux in France. </li>
      <li> <strong> 1878 </strong> The earliest tofu company in the USA, Wo Sing & Co., starts making both fermented and regular tofu in San Francisco. </li>
      <li> <strong> 1910 </strong>-Europe's first commercial soyfoods manufacturer, named Caséo-Sojaïne, is founded by Li Yu-ying, a Chinese citizen, biologist and engineer, in Paris. He sold smoked tofu, pressed tofu sheets, fermented tofu cheese (in Gruyere, Roquefort, and Camembert flavors), and soymilk. </li>
      <li> <strong>1958 </strong>- Tofu is first sold in a U.S. supermarket - Boy's Market in Los Angeles. The tofu was sold in individual packages by putting individual cakes of tofu each in a plastic bag with water and sealing the bag with a heat sealer </li>
      <li> <strong> 1966 </strong> Tofu is first packaged in plastic trays, the type that is used today.</li>
      <li> <strong> 1982 </strong> There are 242 tofu Creators in the Western World, including 173 in the U.S. </li>
      
      <li> <strong> 2019 </strong> The global tofu market is estimated at 2.4 billion dollars and growing. </li>
